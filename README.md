# Client-Website

This is a paid Freelance full stack web development project that I developed for a client.

Main features:
- A standard advtersiement front-end
- Mysql Database
- Sequelize as the ORM package
- User Authentication

It is important to note that this this is the beta version of the website. You will notice there is placeholder text and icons. Those will be updated when my client sends the finalized versions to me.

Enjoy!
